Notes:,,,,,,,
1.    Data in this table may not match previously published data due to retrospective data updates to the National Adoptions Australia Data Collection.,,,,,,,
2.    Data are reported as the median length of time in whole months.,,,,,,,
"3.   This table includes all adoptees who were placed with their adoptive families during each reporting period. It examines the length of time from when applicant(s) became official clients of the department, to when a child or young person was placed with them. ",,,,,,,
"4.    Age is calculated from date of birth, in completed years. For intercountry adoptions, it is the age at which the child is placed with the adoptive family.",,,,,,,
"5.    'Total length of process' is the overall median length of time from when the applicant(s) became official clients of the department, to when the child or young person was placed. It may not be equal to the sum of the preceding processes due to rounding to the nearest whole month and because it is a median.",,,,,,,
"6. ‘Placed with their adoptive families’ refers to when the adoptees enter the home, regardless of the status of their adoption order.",,,,,,,
7.    Entries of '. .' indicate there were either no placements in the age group or in the reporting period.,,,,,,,
"8.    Entries of 'n.p.' indicate that there were fewer than 3 placements in the age group in the reporting period, making a median measure unsuitable.",,,,,,,

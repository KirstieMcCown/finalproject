Notes:,,,,,,
1. Percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding.,,,,,,
2. Changes to the categories of adoption introduced in 1998–99 limits the amount of trend data available for known child adoptions (see Section 2.1).,,,,,,
"3. ‘Other’ was included as a reporting category in 2000–01, but was not consistently used until 2007–08. In addition to adoptions by commissioning parents, adoptions recorded as ‘Other’ prior to 2007–08 may include adoptions where the relationship with the adoptive parent was unknown. ",,,,,,

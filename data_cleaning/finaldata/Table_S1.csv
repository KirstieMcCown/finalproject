(a) Data for 1998–99 may differ from previous reports because of updated figures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(b) On 4 March 2014, the Prime Minister and Attorney-General announced the commencement of amendments to the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements-Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998. These amendments have meant that a number of adoptions from Ethiopia and Taiwan, not yet finalised in Australia, were recognised during 2013–14 as being finalised in previous periods. These updated data are reflected in this report: 1 adoption from Ethiopia in 2006–07; 1 adoption from Ethiopia in 2009–10; 1 adoption from Ethiopia and 1 adoption from Taiwan in 2010–11; 1 adoption from Ethiopia and 7 adoptions from Taiwan in 2011–12; and, 9 adoptions from Taiwan in 2012–13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) Interim adoption orders made by the Children's Court in Queensland are not captured in these data. Under the Adoption Act 2009 (Qld) that began in February 2010, a final adoption order is normally made at the successful completion of a supervised interim order that is completed over a 12-month period. This requirement has affected final adoption orders made in Queensland in 2010–11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(d) Commencing in 2017-18, known child intercountry adoptions are deemed to be out-of-scope for national reporting and are excluded counts of finalised intercountry adoptions. In previous years, national data may have included some cases of known child intercountry adoption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

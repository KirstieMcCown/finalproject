"(c) On 4 March 2014, the Prime Minister and Attorney-General announced the commencement of amendments to the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements-Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998. These amendments have meant that a number of adoptions from Ethiopia and Taiwan, not yet finalised in Australia, were recognised during 2013–14 as being finalised in previous periods. These updated data are reflected in this report: 1 adoption from Ethiopia in 2006–07; 1 adoption from Ethiopia in 2009–10; 1 adoption from Ethiopia and 1 adoption from Taiwan in 2010–11; 1 adoption from Ethiopia and 7 adoptions from Taiwan in 2011–12; and, 9 adoptions from Taiwan in 2012–13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

## Project Overview
<hr>
The ideal goal of this project was to be able to carry out an analysis of data found, in order to make predictions from it, by utilising machine learning.<br>
<br>
<u><h3>Why Mothers and Babies?</h3></u>
<p><br>
Some would say too personal? Some would say extremely cute - but either way you look at it, so many people around us have a mother, are a mother, would love to be a mother, or is a new mother just finding her feet. There is so many women (and men) out there that feel, alone, overwhelmed or stressed about becoming a parent. 
Expanding on current research and giving parents everywhere fact based information and resources would be an invaluable asset.

### About the Data
<p><br>
The data was sourced through the Australian Government and is readily available to anyone who wishes to search for it. However, looking through spreadsheet after spreadsheet, or report after report - is not enjoyable for many people. Having the ability to view the information in a more visual way that is easy to understand and process, makes the information more likely to be understood and remembered.
